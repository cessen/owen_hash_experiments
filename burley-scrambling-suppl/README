In viewpoints.py there are the following sequence you can play with:

random               - using PCG32

faure_05             - (0,5) sequence from Faure 1982

sobol                - Sobol' sequence

sobol_rds            - Sobol' w/ random digit scrambling

sobol_owen           - Sobol' w/ full Owen scrambling and shuffling

sobol_owen_hash_lk   - Sobol' w/ Owen scrambling and shuffling using
                       the Original Laine-Harras hash

sobol_owen_hash_v2   - Sobol' w/ Owen scrambling and shuffling using
                       the hash from
                       https://psychopath.io/post/2021_01_02_sobol_sampling_take_2

sobol_owen_hash_fast - Sobol' w/ Owen scrambling and shuffling using
                       the fast hash from the results in
                       https://psychopath.io/post/2021_01_30_building_a_better_lk_hash

sobol_owen_hash_good - Sobol' w/ Owen scrambling and shuffling using
                       the high-quality hash from the results in
